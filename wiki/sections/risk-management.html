    <h1>Architecture Overview</h1>

    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>The architecture of the ProjectHub system is designed to support a robust and scalable platform for managing
        educational projects. The system is built using a microservices architecture, which allows for independent
        deployment and scaling of different components.</p>

    <h3>Key Components</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>User Management Service</strong>: Handles user registration, authentication, and role-based access control.</li>
        <li><strong>Project Management Service</strong>: Manages project creation, updates, and tracking of project statuses.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Management Service</strong>: Facilitates the creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks associated with projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Management Service</strong>: Oversees the allocation and management of resources required for projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification Service</strong>: Sends notifications to users regarding project updates, task assignments, and deadlines.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: JavaFX for building the user interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Spring Boot for developing microservices.</li>
        <li><strong>Database</strong>: PostgreSQL for data storage and management.</li>
        <li><strong>Messaging</strong>: RabbitMQ for inter-service communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The architecture of ProjectHub is designed to ensure flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, enabling
        efficient management of educational projects and resources.</p>
