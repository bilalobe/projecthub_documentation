# Task Management

## Overview

Task management is a critical component of the ProjectHub platform, ensuring that all tasks are effectively created, assigned, and tracked throughout the project lifecycle. This section outlines the processes and methodologies that will be employed to manage tasks efficiently.

## Task Creation

Tasks will be created by project managers or team leads through a user-friendly interface. Each task will include the following details:

- **Title**: A brief description of the task.
- **Description**: A detailed explanation of the task requirements.
- **Priority**: The urgency of the task (High, Medium, Low).
- **Deadline**: The due date for task completion.
- **Assigned To**: The team member responsible for the task.

## Task Assignment

Once a task is created, it will be assigned to a specific team member based on their skills and availability. The assignment process will include:

- **Selection of Team Member**: Project managers will select the most suitable team member for the task.
- **Notification**: The assigned team member will receive a notification via email and in-app alerts regarding the new task assignment.

## Task Tracking

To ensure that tasks are completed on time, a tracking system will be implemented. This will include:

- **Status Updates**: Team members will be required to update the status of their tasks regularly (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- **Progress Monitoring**: Project managers will have access to dashboards that display the progress of all tasks, allowing for timely interventions if necessary.
- **Reporting**: Weekly reports will be generated to summarize task completion rates and any outstanding tasks.

## Conclusion

Effective task management is essential for the success of the ProjectHub platform. By implementing structured processes for task creation, assignment, and tracking, we aim to enhance productivity and ensure that project goals are met efficiently.
